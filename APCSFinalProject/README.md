## Brief Project description: 
This project will aim to implement a Kingdom Rush map (or two, depending on time constraints) in Processing. Kingdom Rush is a game in the tower defense genre, meaning that the ultimate goal is to keep enemies from entering the objective point. This can be done by setting down “towers” (hence the name) to destroy the enemies before they can advance. There are 4 main types of towers: Ranged, Melee, Magic, and Artillery. Each can be placed in specific slots across the map, while the enemies follow a set path towards the objective. Towers cost money to place down, which is created passively or through killing enemies. As I am not a graphic designer, graphics will be secondary to the basic functionality of the game. I hope I can make a pretty fine project that contains basic gameplay and will be entertaining to play.
